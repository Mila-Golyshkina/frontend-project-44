<h2>About</h2>
<p>"Brain games" is a set of five console games based on the popular mobile brain-pumping apps. Each game asks questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Incorrect answers end the game and prompt you to play it again.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>You should have Node.js installed before proceeding. Only test JS against v19 and on macOS.</p>

<h2>Short guide how to play:</h2>
<p>You can type make brain-games to get only hello from the game. See for example:</p>

<h2>Game 1: "Checking Parity"</h2>
<p>The essence of the game is this: the user is shown a random number. And he has to answer 'yes' if the number is even, or 'no' if it is odd. In case the user gives the wrong answer, the game ends. You must give the correct answer to three questions in a row.</p>
<p>This is example of the game:<p>
